Respository contains the Source Code used while making the Machine Learning Model.It contains 2 research papers which are used to implement the project along with that there is a source code of the implementation. We have used ResNet50 Vgg 16 and Vgg 19 for feautre extraction and used Extreme Learning Machines for training the model in order to advert the back propogation to reduce the training time of the Model. The model was trained on a local machine whose specification are :-
Intel i9-11900K
Nvidia GEForce RTX 3090 24GB 
32 GB DDR4 RAM
7200RPM HDD
